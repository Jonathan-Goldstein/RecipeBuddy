## Usage
The user can click the heart to "like" or save a recipe for future reference. Additionally, users can search for a recipe of their choosing which will also be saved in the Database for future reference.

### Search
Recipe buddy will search the Spoonacular API based on user input. It will get recipes back that match the search term.

### Display Recipe
The images returned from the API will be displayed using Bootstrap's Carousel feature.

### Selection 
The user can click on the picture in the carousel and select a recipe to be included in the shopping list. The user can select one or more recipes, as many as suits their needs.

### Build a List
A shopping list comprised of the ingredients from all the selected recipes will be built. It can be displayed on the users mobile device so they can check off items as they get them in the store.
